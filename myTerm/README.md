# iTermWidget_vAds
This widget takes the previous version developed by @lindazheng and showed in the Scriptable Galery Example. In this version there are some little extra features that have been added, like the current date, system version and automatic location, besides the name of the device is automatic detected and showed on the screen. 

Another feature added in this version is the connectivity with Blynk App, which retrieves the information about your projects in the Blynk service, provided by its API and displayed as a line in the Widget. For my particular case, the data fetched contains temperature, humidity among others relevant data by an IoT system developed by myself using ESP32 and sensors from TOPFLYTECH company. 

Here is an example.

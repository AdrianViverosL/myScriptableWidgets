# Blynk Widget
This widget shows all the data fetched from the Blynk's API where you can find all the information generated by your projects. This is a handcrafted example of a widget implemented to display temperature, humidity, scene and battery lectures from a IoT project developed using ESP32 and Blynk Web app among other technologies. 

The next image show the small size of the widget ( only one available at the moment) where the temperatue es showed with other data, such as the name of the board, hour. These values can be changed and adapted to your personal requirements or desires, just check out the response from the API.

This script has only one support function or method, which is intended to fetch the data from the web platform and pass to the widget constructor.

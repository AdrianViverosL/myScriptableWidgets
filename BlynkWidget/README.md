# Blynk Widget
This widget shows data fetched from the Blynk Web app using Scriptable App for iOS devices. 

You can see all the information generated by your projects. This is a handcrafted example of a widget implemented to display temperature, humidity, scene, and battery values from an IoT project developed using ESP32 as the main microcontroller and Blynk Web app among other technologies. 

This script has the ability to detect the widget size selected by the user, therefore, show the correct amount of information in each size. At the moment only are available small and medium-size. 

* Widgets 
    - Small Size
   In this example, the widget only will display one column with the information of one variable, in this case, temperature. The value is optional and could be modified while you interpret the JSON response from the Blynk API since these values are related to the project you are going to use for this purpose.

    - Medium Size
    In this case, the widget has three rows to display variables. This iteration shows the battery level, temperature, and humidity for each column. The spacing between each column is done automatically by the function ``` addSpacer() ``` which creates the best fit for these amount of information in a row.

Both size versions share common things or labels, like the title, last update hour, device, and connection method. Those are displayed at the top and bottom of the canvas. 

* Support Function
This script has only one backend function which is very simple and the workflow could be described as a simple request to the API and return the relevant data. If the URL is invalid the function throws an error.
